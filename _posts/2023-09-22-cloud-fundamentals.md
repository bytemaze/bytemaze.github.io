## The Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the *on-demand delivery* of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with *pay-as-you-go pricing*. With cloud computing, you donâ€™t need to make large upfront *investments in hardware* and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of *managing that hardware*. Instead, you can provision exactly the *right type and size* of computing resources you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need, almost *instantly*, and only *pay for what you use*. The cloud services platform provides *rapid access to flexible and low-cost* IT resources.

### Advantages of cloud computing

- **Go global in minutes:** Put your application in multiple regions around the world. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
- **Benefit from massive economies of scale:** By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own.
- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers:** Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers. Focus on your business, not the infrastructure.
- **Trade fixed expense for variable expense:** Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
- **Stop guessing capacity:** Eliminate guessing about your infrastructure capacity needs. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need and scale up and down as required in only a few minutes.
- **Increase speed and agility:** In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.

### Concepts

- **High Availability:** Systems are designed to operate continuously without failure for a long time. These systems avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures.
- **Elasticity:** With it, you don't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need. You can provision only what you need, and then grow and shrink based on demand.
- **Agility:** It is defined as the ability to quickly build, test, and deploy applications and software in the cloud as you need it, often in response to market changes.
- **Durability:** Is all about long-term data protection. This means your data will remain intact without corruption.
- **CapEx:** Refers to the costs the organization must incur to purchase fixed assets that will offer ongoing, long-term benefits well past the current tax year.
- **OpEx:** Instead of revolving around one big bill up front, OpEx purchases are typically pay-per-use or subscription-based. With that, OpEx assets are not the exclusive property of the organization that uses them, but of the service provider.

### Cloud Computing Models

- **IaaS:** Contains the building blocks for cloud IT, typically providing access to **network** functions, **computers** (virtual or bare metal), and data **storage** space. OS, configurations, and maintenance are the responsibility of the user.
- **PaaS:** Removes the need for the user to manage the underlying infrastructure (hardware & OS) and allows you to focus on deploying and managing your **applications** (**Data** and **Access**).
- **SaaS:** Gives you a complete solution managed and executed by the service provider, where you don't have to think about how the service is maintained or the underlying infrastructure is managed. Just provide the **data** to the application.

### Cloud Deployment Models

- **Private:** Services and computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. It can be located in the organization (on-premises) or, it can be hosted in the cloud (dedicated cloud offered by cloud providers).
- **Public:** Services offered over the public Internet to individuals and organizations who wish to purchase. Cloud resources (computer, storage, network, and others) are operated by external providers (the owners) and delivered on demand.
- **Hybrid:** Is a combination of **public** and **private** clouds. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to the internal system.

### Regions

A **Region** is a physical location in the world that contains 2 or more Availability Zones. Each region is isolated and fully independent, so if one of them is affected, the others are not. Regions are grouped in geographically isolated locations around the globe, called **Geographical Locations**, On the other hand, most of the resources are tied to a specific Region, and you should set up resources in Regions closest to your users.

### Availability Zones(AZs)

They are a collection of **one** or **more** physically separate **data centers**, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity housed in different facilities. AZs are connected through **low latency** links, are **fault-tolerant**, and allow *high availability*. An AZ is associated with a single Region.
