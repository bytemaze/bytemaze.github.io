# About this website

Not being able to access the information I had on my personal computer from my work computer due to data security issues made me start thinking about a solution that would be available at all times. The first solution I found was to use storage from a cloud provider, but again, the policies of the company I work for presented some impediments.

It was here that the idea of creating a website where I could make my work notes available began to grow. When I started developing the website, I thought that in addition to making my notes available, I could also share these and other notes and reflections with anyone who needs them.
